# Physics 481 Presentation

## Jupyter Notebook

You can view the Jupyter notebook [here](./gmpy.ipynb). If you have time, I recommend running it yourself. 

## Resources

These are probably the most useful resources I found while researching this topic:
- [Floating Point Guide](https://floating-point-gui.de/)
- [Floating Point Converter](https://www.h-schmidt.net/FloatConverter/IEEE754.html)
- [Patriot Missile Failure](https://www.gao.gov/products/imtec-92-26)

And these are longer scientific papers if you want to dive deeper:
- [What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html)
- [The IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/30711)
